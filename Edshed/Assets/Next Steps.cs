    /*Thank you for your time looking over this small project. While I am happy with how it has turned out,
     * I definitely have some things I would like to improve upon however due to the suggested time of around
     * an hour, I have tried to keep things as precise to the brief as I could. 
     * 
     * The next steps I would take if I were to expand upon this include:
     * Score Counter
     * Animations for getting the right and wrong answer
     * Sound effects for the right and wrong answer along with music in the background
     * A main menu UI to lead into the game
     * A secondary game mode where the user gets a definition and must pick the word that fits
     * A boost in optimisation or a short delay while the system gathers the words and definition as currently there is a visible delay
     * 
     * Overall, I'd like to thank you again for this oppurtunity.
     * Thanks,
     * Ben
     * */
